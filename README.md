Hi there! I'm Am√©lie, a Computer Science student studying at Memorial University of Newfoundland.  
I'm mainly proficient in Python, though I'm looking to branch out by making (and breaking :P) things on Github.  
Feel free to reach out with any projects you might be interested in having me take a look at.

Catch me at gremlin#7405 on Discord. <3
